This page contains notes from my research in categorical geometric Langlands.

###  Summer 2023 reading group

This is a reading group organised by Arun Soor and I
in May-June 2023.
The focus is on the unfinished book of
Beilinson--Drinfeld, 
[Quantization of Hitchin's Integrable System and Hecke Eigensheaves](https://math.uchicago.edu/~drinfeld/langlands/QuantizationHitchin.pdf).

The most updated schedule is [here](/pdfs/Geometric_langlands_study_group_schedule.pdf).

Here are notes from the talks.
