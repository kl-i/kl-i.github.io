This page contains notes from my research in categorical geometric Langlands.

### Winter 2023

[Introduction to de Rham geometric Langlands](https://github.com/kl-i/Transfer-thesis/blob/main/main.pdf) :
We give an introduction to de Rham geometric Langlands in characteristic zero. 
We begin with motivation from unramified geometric class field theory for function fields over finite fields. 
A proof is sketched
whose core strategy, the adelic uniformization of the Picard stack, works independently of the characteristic
of the base field. We use the moduli space of Cartier divisors to motivate the more general Beilinson–
Drinfeld Grassmannians as we move from GL1 to arbitrary connected reductive G. 
We use character sheaves to motivate Hecke eigensheaves. 
As we move from a finite base field to a base field of characteristic zero, 
we explain the change from l-adic to de Rham local systems. 
We describe a first approximation
to the definition of the Hecke action in the arbitrary connected reductive case, introducing the Schubert
stratification of the Hecke stack

###  Summer 2023 reading group

This is a reading group organised by Arun Soor and I
in May-June 2023.
The focus is on the unfinished book of
Beilinson--Drinfeld, 
[Quantization of Hitchin's Integrable System and Hecke Eigensheaves](https://math.uchicago.edu/~drinfeld/langlands/QuantizationHitchin.pdf).
