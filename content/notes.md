  )

### Undergraduate at Imperial College London (2018-2022)

- [Galois Theory](https://github.com/kl-i/galois) (First Iteration)

  A very long document I wrote with a friend in the summer of 1st year
  where we wrote _all_ the algebra we knew at the time.
- [Galois Theory](https://github.com/kl-i/galois-200cc/blob/master/main.pdf) (Second Iteration)

  Less than 15 pages.
  I wrote this in 2nd year as an attempt to isolate
  the key part making the fundamental theorem of Galois theory work.
- [Category Theory](https://github.com/kl-i/Notes-on-Category-Theory/blob/master/main.pdf) (First Iteration)

  An info dump of all the category theory I knew 
  in 2nd year winter.
- [Colloquium talk in 3rd year on Filters in Topology](
  https://github.com/kl-i/notes-on-filters
  )
- Talk in 3rd year at the Warwick Imperial Conference (WIMP)
  on _Schemes : the Manifolds of Algebraic Geometry_
 
  - Latex files : [https://github.com/kl-i/WIMP-2020-autumn](https://github.com/kl-i/WIMP-2020-autumn)
  - Video Presentation : To be added
 
  Crystalisation of my understanding of the locally-ringed-space
  approach to schemes.
- [Colloquium talk in 3rd year on "Triangles, Yoneda and Homology"](/pdfs/UGC-triangles.pdf)
- [Notes on Delta Sets](https://github.com/kl-i/notes-on-delta-sets)

  During 3rd year algebraic topology class,
  highly dissatisfied with the messiness in Hatcher's exposition
  of "delta complexes",
  I decided to clean it up using delta sets which Hatcher does not use.
- [Covering Spaces](https://github.com/kl-i/notes-on-covering-spaces) (First Iteration)

  Also 3rd year,
  again dissatified with Hatcher's exposition
  this time of covering spaces,
  I wrote this exposition in an attempt to clean up
  and hence isolate the key parts involved in the 
  "fundamental theorem of covering spaces".
- Covering Spaces (Second Iteration)

  In this iteration, the "formalism" and the "algebraic topology"
  is further isolated.
  A key realisation : 
  semi-locally simple connectedness 
  is precisely "locally 1-categorically contractible"
  and this is an equivalent condition to
  being able to recover topological covering spaces
  from categorical ones (of the fundamental groupoid).
- [ Presheaves ](https://github.com/kl-i/notes-on-presheaves)

  Everything I knew about presheaves in 3rd year summer.
  Key part : phrasing everything in terms of
  the "total space" of a presheaf.
<!-- - [Algebraic Geometry via Functor of Points](https://github.com/kl-i/notes-on-algebraic-geometry)

  An attempt in year 2 summer at an exposition of basic algebraic geometry
  from completely from the functor of points perspective. -->
- [Notes on Model Categories](https://github.com/kl-i/Notes-on-Model-Categories/blob/main/main.pdf)
- [Infinity Categories via Homotopical Segal Condition](https://github.com/kl-i/Notes-on-the-Segal-Condition/blob/main/main.pdf)

  A talk I gave in an online learning group on infinity categories.
